<!-- two types of Pipes. Built in pipes. Custom Pipes. -->

<!-- Built in pipes, comes within the angular which helps to Formatting dates, numbers strings and handling asynchronous dara. -->

<!-- custom pipes: if the built-in pipes are not able to transform the type of data that you wnat, then you can built your own custom pipes to make that thing work -->

<h1> {{ title }} </h1>
<button (click)="upperCase()" >upper case</button>

<h1>{{ title | uppercase }}</h1>

<!-- LowerCae Pipe: Same like uppercase we can just import LowerCasePipe in ts file and just put lowecase after | here in HTML and all good  -->
